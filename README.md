# A plug-in to help streamline Cinema 4D to Unity workflow

This Python plug-in streamlines Cinema 4D to Unity workflow by exporting selected object hierarchies out of a Cinema 4D file as FBX (or Cinema 4D) files.

Frequently when modelling in Cinema 4D I create intermediate meshes, guides, different versions of the same mesh, work in progress “junk”, and so on.

Although Unity is supposed to import entire Cinema 4D files, this is not always convenient, and constantly saving off different parts of a large document into different files quickly gets tedious, especially when trying to work quickly in an iterative fashion.
