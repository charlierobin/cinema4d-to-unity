# A plug-in to help streamline Cinema 4D to Unity workflow
This Python plug-in streamlines Cinema 4D to Unity workflow by exporting selected object hierarchies out of a Cinema 4D file as FBX (or Cinema 4D) files.

Frequently when modelling in Cinema 4D I create intermediate meshes, guides, different versions of the same mesh, work in progress “junk”, and so on.

Although Unity is supposed to import entire Cinema 4D files, this is not always convenient, and constantly saving off different parts of a large document into different files quickly gets tedious, especially when trying to work quickly in an iterative fashion.

In addition, as of the Cinema 4D Release 18 update, it looks as though the import by Unity of native Cinema 4D files is broken. (It certainly is in the versions I have tried, the latest of which is 2017.1.0b6.) Which means the user is pretty much limited to FBX export/import, which adds to the repetitive hassle described above: update work, save out files, etc.
